Task:
I want you to optimize and restructure the architecture of my application based on the provided optimization document.

Steps to Follow:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Read and Analyze the Optimization Plan:

Carefully review the QuickyTrade Performance and Architecture Optimization Plan.
Identify which files and parts of the codebase need modification based on the plan.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Break Down the Tasks into Small Steps:

Since the project consists of a large number of files and code, divide the implementation into small, manageable tasks.
Specify which files need changes and what kind of modifications are required.
For each task, clearly define the expected output and impact.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:

Outline a detailed plan of execution, listing tasks in logical order.
Example format:
üìå Task: Optimize WebSocket connections
üìç File: /src/services/socket.js
üîπ Modification: Implement WebSocket connection sharing
4Ô∏è‚É£ Execute Each Step One by One:

Once the plan is ready, start implementing each step in sequence.
Mark completed tasks with a ‚úÖ checkmark.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Prevent Data/Code Loss:

The transition should be smooth and secure.
Maintain backups and avoid disruptive changes.
Key Optimization Areas to Focus On:
API Optimization: Minimize REST API calls, implement caching, and use GraphQL.
WebSocket Optimization: Reduce WebSocket load, compress messages, and update only when necessary.
Redis Caching Strategy: Implement threshold-based updates for price data.
Next.js Migration: Transition from React SPA to Next.js with SSR and ISR.
Microservices Refactoring: Modularize the backend by separating authentication and Binance API services.
Server & CDN Optimization: Improve load balancing, use Vercel/Cloudflare, and optimize API loads.
Final Goal:
Once this optimization plan is fully implemented, QuickyTrade should have top-tier speed, efficiency, and scalability, ready to handle real-time trading data efficiently. üöÄ
