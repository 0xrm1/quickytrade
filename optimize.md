# 🚀 QuickyTrade Performance and Architecture Optimization Plan

## 📌 Introduction
This document is prepared to **optimize the speed and architecture of the QuickyTrade application**.
By following the steps below, we aim to achieve **a performance level comparable to top trading platforms**.

📍 **Goal:** Faster page loading, lower latency, optimized API calls, and real-time transaction capability.

---

## ✅ 1. API and WebSocket Optimization 

### 🔹 Optimize API Requests
- [ ] **Minimize REST API calls** and prevent unnecessary repetitions.
- [ ] **Use SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) or React Query.**
- [ ] **Implement a caching strategy.**

### 🔹 WebSocket Optimization
- [ ] **Share WebSocket connections for Binance to reduce load.**
- [ ] **Compress WebSocket messages (Gzip, Brotli).**
- [ ] **Update only when the price change exceeds a threshold.**

### 🔹 Cache API Responses with Redis
- [ ] **Cache price data using Redis.**
- [ ] **Update only when a significant price change occurs (Threshold-Based Updates).**
- [ ] **Use WebSocket data but limit Redis updates for efficiency.**

### 🔹 Optimize API with GraphQL
- [ ] **Replace REST with GraphQL to fetch only necessary data.**
- [ ] **Use Apollo Client or Relay for frontend performance boost.**

## ✅ 2. Transition to Next.js and Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### 🔹 Transition to Next.js
- [ ] **Plan the migration from React SPA to Next.js.**
- [ ] **Refactor code to align with the `pages/` structure.**

### 🔹 Page Load Optimization
- [ ] **Pre-cache static pages using ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration).**
- [ ] **Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for dynamic data.**
- [ ] **Process data on the server with Server Components.**

### 🔹 Lazy Loading and Code Splitting
- [ ] **Eliminate unnecessary large file loads (Code Splitting).**
- [ ] **Convert images to WebP / AVIF format.**
- [ ] **Use React Suspense and lazy loading for components.**

---

## ✅ 3. Transition to Microservices Architecture

### 🔹 Backend Modularization
- [ ] **Create a separate microservice for Binance API operations.**
- [ ] **Establish a dedicated service for user authentication and management.**


---

## ✅ 4. Server Infrastructure and Deployment Optimization

### 🔹 Server & CDN Optimization
- [ ] **Increase CDN usage with Vercel or Cloudflare.**
- [ ] **Use Edge Functions for low-latency data delivery.**
- [ ] **Distribute API loads across multiple servers for load balancing.**

---

## ✅ 5. Deployment and Testing Process

### 🔹 Performance Testing
- [ ] **Conduct Lighthouse tests after Next.js migration.**
- [ ] **Measure API response times and keep them below 200ms.**
- [ ] **Test WebSocket connections for latency.**

### 🔹 User Experience Optimization
- [ ] **Perform UX/UI tests and minimize unnecessary page transitions.**
- [ ] **Reduce the first page load time (TTFB) as much as possible.**
