# QuickyTrade Platform

QuickyTrade is a high-performance cryptocurrency trading platform built with a microservices architecture. The platform provides real-time market data, secure authentication, and efficient trading capabilities through the Binance API.

## Architecture Overview

The platform consists of the following microservices:

- **API Gateway**: Main entry point for all client requests, handles routing and load balancing
- **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization
- **Binance API Service**: Handles all interactions with the Binance API, including real-time market data and trading operations

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Nginx
- Docker
- WebSocket
- JWT Authentication

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 16 or later
- MongoDB 6.0
- Redis 7.0
- SSL Certificate (for production)

## Getting Started

### Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quickytrade.git
cd quickytrade
```

2. Create and configure environment files:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start the development environment:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

### Production Environment

1. Configure production environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.prod
```

2. Update the production environment variables in `.env.prod`

3. Start the production environment:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```
